    Older packages that are in the top 5% of packages dependend upon, have slightly more dependents:
    Packages that were created in:
      <ol>
        <li>the past year: 1,317 (median 20)</li>
        <li>the year before: 1,866 (median 24)</li>
        <li>the before that: 1,931 (median 33)</li>
      </ol>
      Age is very weak predictor of dependency (which makes sense - older packages have had more time to get a user base but there are enough very popular and relatively newer packages that break that trend.)
