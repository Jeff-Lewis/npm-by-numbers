  <li>
    The majority of packages on npm, 70,821 (75%), have no packages depending on them.
  </li>

  <li>
    In the top 5% of dependend upon packages, older packages have slightly more dependents, but not much.
    Past year: 1,317 (median 20), the year before: 1,866 (median 24) and the before that: 1,931 (median 33). Age is
    very slight predictor of deep_dependency (which makes sense - older packages have had more time to get a user base.)
